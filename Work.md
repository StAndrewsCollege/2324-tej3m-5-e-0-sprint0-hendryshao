A lot of the online research is about the ones that can use glue and tape. These few that doesn't suggest to use folding so it has a more solid base,
or making small cuts so the the paper can join together to become more stable.
# Plan
I plan to design something with a combination of both. Since I have limited paper, I will cut them into thin pieces and make cuts at the top of the paper, 
so other paper can join them to make the tower taller.

The first sample turned to be stable, but not high enough. There is a lot of paper that could be saved to make a second layer. The papers could be used in a more
efficient way so the tower can be taller.

The second sample is fairly stable, I change the base a little by folding it more times so it is more stable than one fold. The paper that is added on is smaller 
which makes it unstablle, but provides more height. The cuts that are made on the paper is more even so the paper gets a good stand on each other.

# Final design

As i fail to make a significant change to my design, the second sample is the best design i've reach. You first fold the paper horizontally, and seperate the 
paper into three parts, with one being half of the paper and the other two would be quater. Fold the half piece of equally two times to create four column, and make two small cuts in the inner two column. Then place the half piece of paper on the desk, standing up vertically. Now fold the other two paper in half and make two small cuts. Join the papers by cuts so they stand on top of each other.

# Last comments
This design is workable, but how to improve the stability of the papers on the top could be a big problem. As we can't use tape, we might need to make more folds to improve their stability. Generally, this design isn't bad, but would be rather hard to improve upon.
